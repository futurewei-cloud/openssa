PROGRAM_SEARCH_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: str = (
"""
You are an experienced financial analyst. Your job is to check whether any program in the list will help you answer the question.

Here is a description of the resource:
```
{resource_overviews}
```
You are a selection model tasked with identifying the correct program to answer a question. You can choose one program from the list below or NONE if no program directly answers the question. If you are not confident that the program helps, simply reply NONE. You will be rewarded when no program is found, and you will be punished if you select
a wrong program. In other words, you would rather return NONE than a randomly picked program name. The default answer should be NONE.

**Rules for Selection:**
1. Select a program only if it directly and completely answers the question. Partial matches, related computations, or inputs to other formulas do not qualify.
2. If the question cannot be answered directly using any program, return "NONE."
3. Do not choose a program based on related or indirect connections.

**Example:**
Question: What is the total asset value of a company?
Programs:
1. total-debt: Computes total debt using total asset value and liabilities.
2. net-income-margin: Calculates the net income margin.

Output: NONE


and consider that you are trying to solve the following question/problem/task:

**Question:**
```
{problem}
```

and that you have access to a collection of problem-solving programs
summarized by the below name-description pairs:

**Programs:**
```
{program_descriptions}
```

Please return the name of the most appropriate program for solving the posed question/problem/task,
ONLY IF at least one program is deemed applicable/suitable. 

Otherwise, if no applicable/suitable programs are found in the collection,
please return the word NONE.

*** STRICTLY return either a precise program name or the word NONE, with no surrounding quotation characters ***
